# Data-Science-London-Scikit-learn
## Objective
In this project, we are exploring Scikit-learnâ€™s classification capabilities and accuracy estimation techniques using a synthetic dataset provided during a Data Science London meetup. The goal is to develop a binary classifier to categorize 9,000 objects, each represented by 40 numerical features composed of decimal values.
## Dataset
This exercise utilizes a synthetic dataset with 40 features, representing objects from two distinct classes (labeled as 0 or 1). The training set consists of 1,000 samples, while the testing set contains 9,000 samples.
## Model
The chosen architecture for this practice is the Random Forest classifier.
## Accuracy estimation
Accuracy was calculated using the cross-validation method, with the training dataset divided into five folds.
